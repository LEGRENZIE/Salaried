# Salaried
Homework1
The code serves to calculate monthly salaries of both math's teacher and science teacher. Both educators have different hourly ratings. 
In solving this problem I used Object Orientated programming and abstract classes to be able to manipulate data of both educators separately without affecting the other class.
Calculations are done by taking the number of hours worked and multiplying them with the hourly rate to get monthly salary.
